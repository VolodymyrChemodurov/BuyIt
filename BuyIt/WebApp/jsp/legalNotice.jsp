	<h3>Legal notice</h3>
	At common law, notice is the fundamental principle in service of
	process. In this case, the service of process puts the defendant "on
	notice" of the allegations contained within a criminal defendant to be
	notified of the charges and their grounds. If a court bases personal
	jurisdiction over an out-of-state or foreign defendant on a long-arm
	statute, the court must carefully select a means of notifying the
	defendant to comply with the notice requirement of due process.
	Sometimes this is done by serving agents of the defendant located
	within the state. Because out-of-state defendants can't always be
	located easily, some state or local laws may allow for selication. An
	example of this would be printing a notice of the lawsuit in a
	newspaper published where the defendant is believed to reside. Because
	the failure of a defendant to appear in court results in a default
	judgment against him, such measures must be sufficiently calculated to
	give actual notice to the defendant to satisfy due process. In the core
	case setting forth constitutional notice requirements, the U.S. Supreme
	Court held that notice must be "reasonably calculated, under all the
	circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the
	action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections."
	Moreover, defendants must be notified by the "best practical means"
	available.
