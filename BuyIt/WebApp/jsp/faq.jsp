						Lucas. The film series has spawned an extensive media franchise
						called the Expanded Universe including books, television series,
						computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to
						the two film trilogies have resulted in significant development of
						the series' fictional universe. These media kept the franchise
						active in the interim between the film trilogies. The franchise
						depicts a galaxy described as far, far away in the distant past,
						and it commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in
						conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of
						choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture.
						The fictional universe also contains many themes, especially
						influences of philosophy and religion.</div>

It can be used to cut through blast doors or enemies alike. Using the Force, a Jedi can predict and deflect incoming blaster bolts, and reflect them back at the firer.</div>
